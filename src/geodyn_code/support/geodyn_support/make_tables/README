INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CREATE A GEODYN II BINARY EOP AND FLUX FILE

Start with an ascii master file. In this directory it is called 
"master.original".
You can download the "daily" master file from:
https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/geodyn/DAILY_TABLES/master_bih.table
This master file is uploaded daily after creating EOP and flux binary tables
with data from IERS/GFZ/NOAA

1. There are two programs that need to be compiled on your local machine
   a. tabY2Kg.f90
   b. getdate_option.f90

2. compile (comptab)
./comptab


<!-- ifort -o tabY2Kg tabY2Kg.f90 2>err1
ifort -o getdate_option getdate_option.f90 2>err2 -->

3. Have the ascii master file in your directory as 
   master.original

4. Have an empty "emptyfile"  in your directory

5. Execute mk_binary
   This will create a GEODYN binary file with EOP data and Fluxes  
   " gdntable.data "

./mk_binary
