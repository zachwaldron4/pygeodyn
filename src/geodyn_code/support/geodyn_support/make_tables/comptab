# INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CREATE A GEODYN II BINARY EOP AND FLUX FILE
#
#
#
# Start with an ascii master file. In this directory it is called 
# "master.original".
# You can download the "daily" master file from:
# https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/geodyn/DAILY_TABLES/master_bih.table
# This master file is uploaded daily after creating EOP and flux binary tables
# with data from IERS/GFZ/NOAA
#
# 1. There are two programs that need to be compiled on your local machine
#    a. tabY2Kg.f90
#    b. getdate_option.f90
#
# 2. compile (comptab)
#
# ifort -o tabY2Kg tabY2Kg.f90 2>err1
# ifort -o getdate_option getdate_option.f90 2>err2
#
# 3. Have the ascii master file in your directory as 
#    master.original
#
# 4. Have an empty "emptyfile"  in your directory
#
# 5. Execute mk_binary
#    This will create a GEODYN binary file with EOP data and Fluxes  
#    " gdntable.data "

chmod a+w *mod *.o
rm *mod *.o


# Compile subroutines using same compile configuration as the GEOYDN files.
gfortran -pg -std=legacy -fdefault-integer-8 -fcray-pointer -O2 tabY2Kg.f90 2>comperr -o tabY2Kg
# ifort -o tabY2Kg tabY2Kg.f90 2>comperr
gfortran -pg -std=legacy -fdefault-integer-8 -fcray-pointer -O2 getdate_option.f90 2>comperr -o getdate_option
# ifort -o getdate_option getdate_option.f90 2>comperr
# -fdefault-integer-8
#-fdefault-integer-8

#####   -c flag   : Compile only, do not procude executable
#####   -o flag   : Specify name of object, library, or executable file to write (-o filename)
#####   -O2 flag  : Enables basic block level optimizations.
#####   -pg       : allows linking for the GPROF profiler
#####
#####  -std=legacy 
###             Specify the standard to which the program is expected to conform, 
###             which may be one of ‘f95’, ‘f2003’, ‘f2008’, ‘f2018’, ‘gnu’, or ‘legacy’.
###             The default value for std is ‘gnu’, which specifies a superset of the latest Fortran
###             standard that includes all of the extensions supported by GNU Fortran, although 
###             warnings will be given for obsolete extensions not recommended for use in new code.
###             The ‘legacy’ value is equivalent but without the warnings for 
###             obsolete extensions, and may be useful for old non-standard programs.
##### -fdefault-integer-8 
###             Set the default integer and logical types to an 8 byte wide type.
###             This option also affects the kind of integer constants like 42. 
###             Unlike -finteger-4-integer-8, it does not promote variables with explicit kind declaration.
#####  -fcray-pointer 
###             Enable the Cray pointer extension, which provides C-like pointer functionality.
#####  -llapack and -lblas
###             LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a FORTRAN program system for solving linear equations for
###             matrices which fit entirely in core. Links to LAPACK and its associated BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines)
