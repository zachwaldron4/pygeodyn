1. Sources of programs that need to be compiled on your platform.
ascii_to_binary.f90
create_ephemeris.f90

2. Use the compile script to compile the sources:
compile*
You will create two executables:
ascii_to_binary_eph430*
create_ephemeris*

3. Ascii files we have created from JPL data pertaining to ephemeris 430
Need to be present in the directory you create the ephemeris.
ascii_header_430
ascp1950.430

4. Execute
RUN1_EPH_430*
The following file will be created:
hdr_template_bn_new

5. Execute 
RUN2_EPH_430*
The file ephem430.data will be created. This is the input binary file 
on unit 1 when running GEODYN IIS.
